# Retaliator

I'm a junior web-dev who has been into games since very young, and I also have a growing interest in the rust language. To kill two birds with one stone, I thought I'd try my hands at building a game in godot using the rust bindings. It's taking a bit of getting used-to, but it has also been very fun. It's definitely different from the wholly strict oop I've done in the past. I've been meaning to build a kind of game in the style of old boomer shooters, and one that is close to my heart is Marathon, so that is currently what I'm working on! As someone who has a fondness for verber noun names, Retaliator seemed appropriate, as a game about someone trying to fight off an alien attack.
